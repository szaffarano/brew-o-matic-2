# Brew o Matic

This is an intent to rewrite [BoM](https://github.com/lautarobock/brew-o-matic) using [PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) and [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/).

## Requirements

You have to install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) and either [npm](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/).  I recommend using [nvm] (https://github.com/creationix/nvm), which is a great node version manager.

## Development mode

Please move to the ```backend``` directory and execute

```sh
$ cd backend
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```

This will start the server (web services) application.  Then, move to the ```frontend``` directory and run

```sh
$ cd frontend
$ yarn 
$ yarn dev
```

The system default browser should be opened and the web application displayed

## Build
